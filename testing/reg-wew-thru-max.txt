# lump together wall checks in 1st room
>w
Though the way west is pretty clearly blocked, you walk up press against the wall briefly. Then you have a hard time pulling away. You realize the walls must be coated with Uck-Stay-Stuck. Best stick (ha) to going north and east.
>w
No, west would run into a wall covered with Uck-Stay-Stuck. Looks like north and east would work better.
>eat uck
There's no point in trying to pick at the Uck-Stay-Stuck. You need to figure how to escape.

>x slurp
Far too indescribable for words. And even if you or I could do so easily, we wouldn't want to. It's there, and you need to escape it.
Also, you sense trying to do anything directly to, or using anything on, the Urp-Slay-Slurp would be useless. Escape is the only route, finding other stuff to muck with.

Though the way north is pretty clearly blocked, you walk up press against the wall briefly. You hear a wailing. "Who dares come near the Lane Say-Slain?" Somehow, you doubt much will turn up by the Lane Say-Slain. Better to go south to X-Ray Wrecks and east.
>w
The wailing from the Lane Say-Slain starts up again to the west. It seems like there's easier progress south to X-Ray Wrecks and east.
>eat slain
The Lane Say-Slain is just sort of there. The more you think of it, the more you'll be distracted by fear. Best put it out of your mind.

No chance. The Urp-Slay-Slurp would catch you. You need to fix your blimp somehow! Maybe you are even carrying what you need.

Running into walls would do no good. You need to fix your blimp somehow! Maybe you are even carrying what you need.

There's no weird direction to get out of here. Well, maybe there is, but you'd need to fix the blimp to go that way.
